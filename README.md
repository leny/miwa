> Dynamic ORM for node.js

**miwa** is an ORM for `node.js`. But a dynamic ORM : based on the structure of the database, **miwa** creates `classes`, `methods` and `properties` to manipulate data in the code.

I think the database should be the only responsible for its structure.

**miwa** is adapted from [leny/zewo](http://github.com/leny/zewo), an old PHP project based on the same idea.

I plan to support MySQL, SQLite & postgresQL.
